## Automated Testing Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Pre-Deployment Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run build
        run: npm run build
