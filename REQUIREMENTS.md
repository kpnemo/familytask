# FamilyTasks - Web Application Requirements (Updated)

## Project Overview
A comprehensive web-based family task management application that engages kids in completing household tasks through a gamified points system. Parents create and assign tasks, kids complete them, and points can be exchanged for real-world rewards through the integrated reward shop.

## Core Features

### User Management
- Simple registration with email/password (no email verification)
- Family structure: One family per parent, multiple parents allowed
- Roles: Admin Parent, Parent, Child (no age restrictions)
- Family invite system: First registered family member gets a family code, others join using this code during registration
- **âœ… Family member management**: Edit names, remove members (parent/admin only)

### Task Management
- Parents create tasks and assign to children
- **âœ… Children can create tasks** with restrictions (zero points, no bonus tasks)
- **âœ… Bonus Tasks system**: Unassigned tasks available for self-assignment by any family member
- Task properties: title, description, points (default: 1), due date, tags
- Workflow: Child completes â†’ Parent verifies â†’ Points awarded
- Support for recurring tasks
- **âœ… Single task view**: Detailed task page with role-based actions
- **âœ… Task completion**: Complete, verify, decline functionality
- **âœ… Task deletion**: Parents/admins can delete any task with proper points reversal
- **âœ… Overdue detection**: Visual indicators for past-due tasks
- **âœ… Self-assignment**: "Assign to Me" button for available bonus tasks

### Points System
- Points earned for verified task completion
- Points accumulate (no monthly reset)
- **âœ… Reward Shop**: Parents can deduct points for real-world rewards
- **âœ… Points history**: Complete transaction log with running balance
- **âœ… Balance tracking**: Before/after amounts for all transactions
- Hall of Fame leaderboard for all family children

### Notifications
- **âœ… Enhanced in-app notifications** with mobile-responsive popup positioning
- **âœ… SMS notifications** for task events (when Twilio configured)
- Real-time updates for task assignments, completions, verifications, bonus task creation
- **âœ… Notification bell with unread count**
- **âœ… Clickable task notifications**: Navigate directly to task details
- **âœ… Individual notification management**: Mark read, delete individual notifications
- **âœ… Bulk actions**: Clear all notifications
- **âœ… Bonus task notifications**: All family members notified when bonus tasks are created

### Core Pages
- **âœ… Dashboard with dual styles**: Classic and Enhanced dashboards with bonus tasks prominently displayed
- **âœ… Task management** (list, create, details, edit) with bonus task support
- **âœ… Points overview and history with reward shop**
- Hall of Fame leaderboard
- **âœ… Enhanced family management** with family code display and member management
- **âœ… Settings page** with profile management, family member controls, and SMS settings
- Basic analytics for parents
